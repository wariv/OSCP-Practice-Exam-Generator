# OSCP-Practice-Exam-Generator

Just a little app I wrote to streamline picking and practicing machines for the OSCP. Nothing fancy, nothing elegant. I don't program for a living, sorry.

THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE YOU WILL PASS THE OSCP!!!!

Big thanks Thanks to TJ Null and his OSCP like list.

It doesn't do points or anything. But if you can reliably knock out 4 machines in a decent time. You should be in a good spot.
